00:00.875 --> 00:04.671
The structure of DNA includes base
pairs between the two DNA strands.

00:05.171 --> 00:07.799
These base pairs are flat structures.

00:07.799 --> 00:10.802
Some chemicals can fit in between
adjacent base pairs.

00:11.052 --> 00:13.763
These are called intercalating
agents.

00:13.763 --> 00:16.975
Intercalating agents
can affect DNA polymerases ability

00:16.975 --> 00:19.978
to properly read and copy the DNA.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.855
It can result in mutations.
