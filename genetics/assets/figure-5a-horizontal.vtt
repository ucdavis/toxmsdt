00:01.251 --> 00:03.795
Ultraviolet light produced by the sun
is capable of

00:03.795 --> 00:06.965
damaging DNA by causing
chemical changes in its structure.

00:07.632 --> 00:10.885
A major type of chemical changes
the formation of thymine dimers

00:10.885 --> 00:13.388
between adjacent thymine residues.

00:13.388 --> 00:16.099
These dimers affect
DNA replication and,

00:16.099 --> 00:20.061
if unrepaired, can lead to mutations
that ultimately can lead to cancer.
