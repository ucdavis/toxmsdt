00:00.120 --> 00:00.800
Agarose gel

00:00.800 --> 00:01.920
electrophoresis is a

00:01.920 --> 00:02.640
technique used

00:02.640 --> 00:04.360
to separate DNA fragments

00:04.360 --> 00:06.160
or other macromolecules, such

00:06.160 --> 00:07.680
as RNA and proteins,

00:07.680 --> 00:10.000
based on their size and charge.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
The first step for DNA fragments

00:12.000 --> 00:14.040
separation is the gel preparation

00:14.040 --> 00:16.040
or gel casting.

00:16.040 --> 00:17.680
An appropriate amount of agarose

00:17.680 --> 00:20.680
powder is weighed out.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.160
For standard agarose

00:22.160 --> 00:23.400
gel electrophoresis.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.440
Larger molecules are resolved better

00:25.440 --> 00:26.800
using a low concentration

00:26.800 --> 00:27.560
gel, while

00:27.560 --> 00:28.840
smaller molecules separate

00:28.840 --> 00:31.840
better at high concentrate gel.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.600
Once the agarose has been weighed,

00:33.600 --> 00:34.800
an appropriate buffer

00:34.800 --> 00:37.200
such as tar or TB, is poured

00:37.200 --> 00:40.200
into the bottle.

00:45.880 --> 00:46.400
Agarose

00:46.400 --> 00:47.360
does not dissolve

00:47.360 --> 00:50.160
until it is heated.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.080
Therefore, the solution is heated

00:52.080 --> 00:52.920
for a few seconds

00:52.920 --> 00:55.920
in a microwave oven.

00:57.480 --> 00:59.560
Once the agarose is fully dissolved,

00:59.560 --> 01:02.760
the solution is cooled to about 55°C

01:02.760 --> 01:03.720
in a water bath.

01:05.160 --> 01:05.920
while the agarose

01:05.920 --> 01:07.760
solution is cooling,

01:07.760 --> 01:09.200
an electrophoresis tank

01:09.200 --> 01:10.520
with a negative electrode

01:10.520 --> 01:11.200
and a positive

01:11.200 --> 01:12.480
electrode is prepared

01:12.480 --> 01:14.560
for gel casting.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.080
The comb is placed in the tank

01:16.080 --> 01:19.080
to create wells for loading samples.

01:20.120 --> 01:20.880
Then, casting

01:20.880 --> 01:22.360
dams are fixed in the tank

01:22.360 --> 01:23.880
so that the agarose solution

01:23.880 --> 01:26.880
does not flow out during setting.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.720
Once the agarose solution has cooled

01:29.720 --> 01:32.720
to about 55°C

01:33.800 --> 01:34.360
and before

01:34.360 --> 01:36.240
pouring it into the electrophoresis

01:36.240 --> 01:39.240
tank, the Citium bromide is added.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.160
The idiom bromide is highly toxic

01:42.160 --> 01:43.160
as a mutagen,

01:43.160 --> 01:44.400
so it must be carefully

01:44.400 --> 01:47.400
handled in a fume hood.

01:52.560 --> 01:53.680
The sodium bromide is

01:53.680 --> 01:55.240
an intercalated agent

01:55.240 --> 01:56.240
which interpolates

01:56.240 --> 01:56.920
between base

01:56.920 --> 01:59.920
pairs of the DNA molecule.

02:01.440 --> 02:02.360
When it is exposed

02:02.360 --> 02:03.600
to ultraviolet light.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.160
It will fluoresce

02:05.160 --> 02:07.680
and DNA bands become visible.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.040
The more DNA present,

02:09.040 --> 02:10.120
the brighter the band.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.920
After addition of Ethereum bromide,

02:14.920 --> 02:16.480
the agarose solution is poured

02:16.480 --> 02:19.480
into the electrophoresis tank.

02:20.880 --> 02:22.320
Then the gel is allowed

02:22.320 --> 02:25.320
to solidify at room temperature.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.600
Once the gel has solidified,

02:27.600 --> 02:29.200
the comb is carefully removed

02:29.200 --> 02:32.200
as well as the casting dams.

02:32.280 --> 02:34.680
Next, the gel is submerged in a tar

02:34.680 --> 02:36.920
or TB running buffer,

02:36.920 --> 02:38.520
which used to provide ions

02:38.520 --> 02:39.840
that carry a current

02:39.840 --> 02:41.240
and to maintain the pH

02:41.240 --> 02:43.800
of a relatively constant value.

02:43.800 --> 02:44.920
After the preparation

02:44.920 --> 02:46.040
of the agarose gel,

02:46.040 --> 02:46.920
the next step

02:46.920 --> 02:47.160
is the

02:47.160 --> 02:50.160
preparation of the DNA samples.

02:51.440 --> 02:52.840
The loading buffer is added to

02:52.840 --> 02:54.960
each sample.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.120
This buffer contains

02:56.120 --> 02:57.680
glycerol in certain dyes

02:57.680 --> 03:00.680
such as bromophenol blue,

03:01.200 --> 03:02.680
and it is used to add density

03:02.680 --> 03:03.680
to the sample,

03:03.680 --> 03:06.680
allowing it to sink into the gel

03:06.880 --> 03:08.880
to provide color and simplify

03:08.880 --> 03:10.200
the loading process,

03:10.200 --> 03:11.920
and to allow the user to monitor

03:11.920 --> 03:13.480
the progress of the separation.

03:14.760 --> 03:15.560
Before loading the

03:15.560 --> 03:17.160
samples into the wells,

03:17.160 --> 03:18.440
a molecular weight size

03:18.440 --> 03:19.920
marker, known as a DNA

03:19.920 --> 03:21.360
ladder is commonly

03:21.360 --> 03:23.000
used as a standard reference

03:23.000 --> 03:23.800
that contains

03:23.800 --> 03:26.800
DNA fragments of known lengths.

03:27.520 --> 03:28.760
It is loaded into the first

03:28.760 --> 03:31.760
well of the agarose gel.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.120
Once the molecular weight

03:33.120 --> 03:35.040
size marker has been loaded,

03:35.040 --> 03:36.640
the DNA samples are loaded

03:36.640 --> 03:39.640
into the wells.

03:43.320 --> 03:44.520
After adding the samples

03:44.520 --> 03:45.640
into the wells,

03:45.640 --> 03:46.480
a lid is placed

03:46.480 --> 03:48.480
on the electrophoresis tank.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.920
Then an electric current

03:49.920 --> 03:51.360
is applied to pull the samples

03:51.360 --> 03:52.360
through the gel

03:52.360 --> 03:54.120
based on their charge and size.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.000
The DNA molecules will travel

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
through the gel at different speeds.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.320
The DNA molecules have

04:01.320 --> 04:02.280
a negative charge

04:02.280 --> 04:03.800
because of the phosphate groups

04:03.800 --> 04:06.800
and their sugar phosphate backbone.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.840
Therefore, when placed in

04:08.840 --> 04:09.840
an electric field,

04:09.840 --> 04:11.640
DNA fragments start moving

04:11.640 --> 04:12.920
through the matrix of the gel

04:12.920 --> 04:14.160
towards the positive pole.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.120
Because all

04:19.120 --> 04:20.160
DNA fragments

04:20.160 --> 04:21.480
have the same amount of charge

04:21.480 --> 04:22.360
per mass.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.280
Small fragments

04:23.280 --> 04:24.120
move through the gel

04:24.120 --> 04:27.120
faster than large ones.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.120
Due to the relatively small molecule

04:34.120 --> 04:35.800
size of bromo phenol blue.

04:35.800 --> 04:36.560
It migrates

04:36.560 --> 04:38.080
faster than DNA

04:38.080 --> 04:39.480
and by optical control

04:39.480 --> 04:41.080
of the migrating colored band.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.840
The electrophoresis can be stopped

04:42.840 --> 04:43.720
before the dye.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.000
So before the samples

04:45.000 --> 04:46.320
have completely migrated

04:46.320 --> 04:49.320
through the gel and leave it.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.840
Once the DNA fragments

04:51.840 --> 04:53.160
have been separated,

04:53.160 --> 04:55.520
the gel is placed under UV light.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.160
Then the DNA fragments

04:57.160 --> 04:58.720
can be seen as bands.

04:58.720 --> 04:59.400
Each band

04:59.400 --> 05:01.320
contains a large number of DNA

05:01.320 --> 05:02.880
fragments of the same size,

05:02.880 --> 05:03.960
that have all traveled

05:03.960 --> 05:06.960
as a group to the same position.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.520
By comparing the DNA

05:08.520 --> 05:09.600
bands of the samples

05:09.600 --> 05:10.960
to the DNA latter,

05:10.960 --> 05:12.000
we can determine their

05:12.000 --> 05:13.120
approximate sizes.
