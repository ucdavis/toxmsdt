00:00.959 --> 00:04.045
Various toxic agents can cause
damage to the DNA

00:04.045 --> 00:05.839
by breaking the backbone.

00:05.839 --> 00:09.342
A break in one of the two backbones
is less dangerous because the double

00:09.342 --> 00:12.554
helix can be held together
by the remaining intact strand.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.724
However,
if both strands are broken, a

00:15.724 --> 00:18.977
double strand break,
the DNA can be completely severed.
