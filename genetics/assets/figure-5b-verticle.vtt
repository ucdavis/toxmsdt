00:01.418 --> 00:02.127
Another common

00:02.127 --> 00:05.422
type of DNA damage is caused
by certain classes of chemicals.

00:05.880 --> 00:10.176
benzo[a]pyrene a common product
of combustion from wood and tobacco,

00:10.301 --> 00:13.346
is capable of chemically reacting
with the bases of DNA.

00:14.014 --> 00:17.976
This interferes with the ability
of DNA to base pair, and often causes

00:17.976 --> 00:22.939
the DNA normal double helix to bulge.
Similar to thymine dimers,

00:22.981 --> 00:26.651
these bulky attacks can prevent
DNA replication and lead to cancer.
