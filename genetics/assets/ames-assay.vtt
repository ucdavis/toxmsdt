00:00.625 --> 00:02.961
Bruce Ames invented the Ames assay

00:02.961 --> 00:03.962
as a way to determine

00:03.962 --> 00:05.922
if substances were mutagenic.

00:05.922 --> 00:08.091
He generated a strain of salmonella

00:08.091 --> 00:09.426
typhimurium

00:09.426 --> 00:10.427
with a zero point mutation

00:10.427 --> 00:12.178
in the histidine gene.

00:12.178 --> 00:14.014
A very small number of bacteria

00:14.014 --> 00:15.890
will undergo a spontaneous mutation

00:15.890 --> 00:17.559
to restore this gene,

00:17.559 --> 00:18.643
allowing salmonella

00:18.643 --> 00:20.770
to grow without histidine.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.105
If exposed to a mutagen

00:22.147 --> 00:23.481
more of the bacteria will have

00:23.481 --> 00:25.275
this enzyme restored,

00:25.275 --> 00:26.609
resulting in more colonies

00:26.609 --> 00:27.819
on the test plate

00:27.819 --> 00:28.820
than the control plate.
