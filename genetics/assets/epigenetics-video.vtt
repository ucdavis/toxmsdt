00:06.965 --> 00:08.633
Here's a conundrum.

00:08.633 --> 00:11.636
Identical twins
originate from the same DNA.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.139
So how can they turn out
so different,

00:14.139 --> 00:17.142
even in traits that have
a significant genetic component?

00:17.600 --> 00:20.562
For instance,
why might one twin get heart disease

00:20.562 --> 00:24.524
at 55 while her sister runs marathons
in perfect health?

00:25.108 --> 00:29.070
Nature versus nurture has a lot
to do with it, but a deeper related

00:29.070 --> 00:32.407
answer can be found within
something called epigenetics.

00:33.033 --> 00:36.578
That's the study of how DNA interacts
with the multitude

00:36.578 --> 00:39.581
of smaller molecules
found within cells,

00:39.581 --> 00:42.584
which can activate
and deactivate genes.

00:43.126 --> 00:47.547
If you think of DNA as a recipe book,
those molecules are largely

00:47.547 --> 00:49.591
what determine what gets cooked

00:49.591 --> 00:53.470
when they aren't making any conscious
choices themselves.

00:53.762 --> 00:54.846
Rather, their presence

00:54.846 --> 00:57.849
and concentration
within cells makes the difference.

00:58.391 --> 00:59.851
So how does that work?

00:59.851 --> 01:03.063
Genes in DNA are expressed
when they're read

01:03.063 --> 01:06.566
and transcribed into RNA,
which is translated

01:06.566 --> 01:09.694
into proteins
by structures called ribosomes.

01:10.445 --> 01:13.782
And proteins are much of what
determines a cell's characteristics

01:13.782 --> 01:15.283
and function.

01:15.283 --> 01:18.536
Epigenetic changes
can boost or interfere

01:18.536 --> 01:21.539
with the transcription
of specific genes.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.918
The most common way
interference happens is that DNA,

01:25.168 --> 01:27.128
or the proteins it's wrapped around,

01:27.128 --> 01:29.798
gets labeled
with small chemical tags.

01:29.798 --> 01:33.927
The set of all of the chemical tags
that are attached to the genome of a

01:33.927 --> 01:36.930
given cell is called the epigenome.

01:37.388 --> 01:41.101
Some of these, like a methyl group,
inhibit gene expression

01:41.351 --> 01:44.354
by derailing
the cellular transcription machinery

01:44.562 --> 01:48.942
or causing the DNA to coil
more tightly, making it inaccessible.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.445
The gene is still there,
but it's silent.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.532
Boosting transcription
is essentially the opposite.

01:55.657 --> 01:59.744
Some chemical tags
will unwind the DNA, making it easier

01:59.744 --> 02:03.665
to transcribe, which ramps up
production of the associated protein.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.544
Epigenetic changes can survive
cell division,

02:07.544 --> 02:11.172
which means that they could affect
an organism for its entire life.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.424
Sometimes that's a good thing.

02:13.424 --> 02:16.427
Epigenetic changes
are part of normal development.

02:16.427 --> 02:19.430
The cells in an embryo start
with one master genome.

02:19.681 --> 02:23.184
As the cells divide,
some genes are activated and others

02:23.184 --> 02:27.105
inhibited over time
through this epigenetic reprograming.

02:27.313 --> 02:31.025
Some cells develop into heart cells
and others into liver cells.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.737
Each of the approximately 200
cell types in your body

02:34.904 --> 02:39.159
has essentially the same genome,
but its own distinct epigenome.

02:40.034 --> 02:43.163
The epigenome also mediates
a lifelong dialog

02:43.246 --> 02:45.957
between genes and the environment.

02:45.957 --> 02:50.587
The chemical tags that turn genes on
and off can be influenced by factors

02:50.587 --> 02:54.007
including diet,
chemical exposure, and medication.

02:54.757 --> 02:58.511
The resulting epigenetic changes
can eventually lead to disease

02:58.511 --> 02:59.846
if, for example,

02:59.846 --> 03:03.308
they turn off a gene that makes
a tumor suppressing protein.

03:04.267 --> 03:08.021
Environmentally induced epigenetic
changes are part of the reason

03:08.021 --> 03:12.317
why genetically identical twins can
grow up to have very different lives.

03:12.942 --> 03:16.112
As twins get older,
their epi genomes diverge,

03:16.404 --> 03:20.116
affecting the way they age
and their susceptibility to disease.

03:20.909 --> 03:24.287
Even social experiences
can cause epigenetic changes.

03:24.704 --> 03:28.291
In one famous experiment,
when mother rats weren't attentive

03:28.291 --> 03:31.544
enough to their pups, genes
in the babies that help them

03:31.544 --> 03:35.089
manage stress were methylated
and turned off,

03:35.840 --> 03:38.509
and it might not stop
with that generation.

03:38.509 --> 03:42.847
Most epigenetic marks are erased
when egg and sperm cells are formed.

03:43.389 --> 03:47.143
But now researchers think
that some of those imprints survive,

03:47.560 --> 03:50.897
passing those epigenetic traits
on to the next generation.

03:51.689 --> 03:55.944
Your mother's or your father's
experiences as a child, or choices

03:55.944 --> 03:59.239
as adults could actually
shape your own epigenome.

03:59.864 --> 04:00.615
But even though

04:00.615 --> 04:04.452
epigenetic changes are sticky,
they're not necessarily permanent.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.914
A balanced lifestyle
that includes a healthy diet,

04:07.914 --> 04:10.917
exercise,
and avoiding exposure to contaminants

04:11.000 --> 04:14.170
may, in the long
run, create a healthy epigenome.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.632
It's an exciting time to be studying
this.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.885
Scientists are just beginning
to understand how epigenetics

04:21.135 --> 04:24.222
could explain mechanisms
of human development and aging,

04:24.764 --> 04:27.517
as well as the origins of cancer,
heart disease,

04:27.517 --> 04:30.853
mental illness, addiction,
and many other conditions.

04:31.437 --> 04:34.065
Meanwhile, new genome
editing techniques

04:34.065 --> 04:36.401
are making it much easier to identify

04:36.401 --> 04:40.196
which epigenetic changes
really matter for health and disease.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.658
Once we understand
how our epigenome influences

04:43.658 --> 04:46.703
us, we might
be able to influence it to.
