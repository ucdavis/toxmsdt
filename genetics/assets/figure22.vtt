00:00.875 --> 00:03.461
Epigenetic changes are changes to DNA

00:03.461 --> 00:06.464
that does not affect
the actual genetic code.

00:06.673 --> 00:09.759
The primary example is methylation,
which affects the expression

00:09.759 --> 00:11.219
of genes.

00:11.219 --> 00:13.346
In the top example, exposure

00:13.346 --> 00:17.392
to toxicant before conception alters
the sperm or the egg prior

00:17.392 --> 00:21.646
to fertilization occurring,
which is then passed to the child.

00:22.439 --> 00:25.066
In the bottom example,
the fetus is exposed

00:25.066 --> 00:28.069
and this alters
the epigenetic code of the child.

00:28.236 --> 00:31.906
In both cases, these changes can be
passed to future generations.
