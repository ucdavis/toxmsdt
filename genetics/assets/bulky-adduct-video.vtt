00:00.166 --> 00:02.961
Bulky
adducts, in this case a polycyclic

00:02.961 --> 00:06.214
aromatic hydrocarbon
produced from incomplete combustion,

00:06.548 --> 00:09.009
covalently attaches to the DNA.

00:09.009 --> 00:12.012
Bulky
adducts can prevent DNA replication.

00:16.599 --> 00:17.017
In this

00:17.017 --> 00:20.020
molecular view,
adenine shown on the left

00:20.020 --> 00:23.773
is attacked by an epoxide
residue found on benzo(a)pyrene .

00:24.357 --> 00:27.610
This results in the covanta linkage
between the benzo(a)pyrene

00:27.610 --> 00:30.613
and the adenine residue.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.993
In this representation of the DNA
helix,

00:34.993 --> 00:37.245
the covalent
bonding of benzo(a)pyrene

00:37.245 --> 00:40.540
to the base interferes with
its ability to form a hydrogen bond

00:40.665 --> 00:44.377
with the complementary base
on the other DNA strand, distorting

00:44.377 --> 00:45.503
the shape of the helix.
