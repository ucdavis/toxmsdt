00:02.585 --> 00:04.921
So welcome to Fable Farmstead.

00:04.921 --> 00:08.675
Can you tell me a little bit
about yourselves, how you came here

00:08.675 --> 00:11.678
and how you learned
about pivots on your land?

00:11.761 --> 00:14.764
Sure. My name is Laura.
My name is Winslow.

00:14.806 --> 00:18.226
And we had a farm about 20 minutes
from here that we outgrew.

00:18.309 --> 00:19.811
So we moved to Freeport.

00:19.811 --> 00:24.065
In 2020,
we bought this place and we found out

00:24.691 --> 00:28.319
just as we were moving up
here, moving farms up here, that our field

00:28.361 --> 00:31.364
had had sludge
spread on them in the early 90s,

00:32.365 --> 00:35.076
that it's devastating.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.412
You know, as I grew up,

00:37.412 --> 00:40.832
Dairy Farm was never something
we had to think about as kids.

00:41.332 --> 00:45.253
And, yeah, we're raising a family here.

00:45.420 --> 00:49.507
And so we weren't sure how
that was going to affect our decision

00:49.507 --> 00:50.675
to continue farming.

00:50.675 --> 00:54.054
If we could farm where remediation was
going to look like, if that was possible.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.307
That was just terrible, actually.

00:57.307 --> 00:59.309
And what are you hoping to do now?

00:59.309 --> 01:02.312
That, you know, where
there might be on your land?

01:02.687 --> 01:05.565
Well, luckily, we found out that we had

01:05.565 --> 01:08.735
contamination in our field
before we started farming here.

01:09.152 --> 01:13.823
So we were able to adjust our plan,
as to where the crops would be grown.

01:14.199 --> 01:17.869
So we've done extensive testing,
which we paid for out of pocket,

01:17.952 --> 01:23.208
to all of our fields
and where we have clean soil results.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.876
That's where we've been growing our crop.

01:24.876 --> 01:29.255
We did a test, a trial plot as well,
to test the actual plant matter.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.592
So we know that the food
that's coming out of that field is safe.

01:32.801 --> 01:36.262
So moving forward,
we will only be planting where we know it

01:36.262 --> 01:38.014
is safe for us to do so.

01:38.014 --> 01:41.851
We're also partnering with institutions
to do people's,

01:41.893 --> 01:45.814
remediation research
because we want to be part of the problem.

01:46.147 --> 01:47.649
Solution.

01:49.192 --> 01:52.403
And yeah, this is a big problem.

01:52.403 --> 01:55.573
And we want to try
to get rid of it. Great.

01:55.573 --> 01:59.077
And what would you say to students
first learning about fast

01:59.077 --> 02:02.080
for the first time?

02:02.080 --> 02:03.498
It's everywhere.

02:03.498 --> 02:08.253
We didn't realize how ubiquitous
it was in our world and our environment.

02:08.294 --> 02:13.341
It's on everything, basically,
that we touch or eat or use.

02:13.925 --> 02:18.888
And that's really scary because
you never really know how much is then

02:20.098 --> 02:21.349
going into your body.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.725
You can't really avoid it.

02:22.725 --> 02:26.020
But when you know
that there is contamination, when you know

02:26.020 --> 02:29.399
that there is something wrong,
at least you can do your best to avoid it.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.734
Great. Well, thank you so much.

02:31.734 --> 02:32.902
We really appreciate it.
