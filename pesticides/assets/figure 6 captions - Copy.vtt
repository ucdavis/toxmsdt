00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.700
Nervous system control is exerted through 

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.866
the autonomic and somatic divisions.   

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.332
The somatic nervous system controls

4
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.033
voluntary responses, so these nerves

5
00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:13.433
communicate with skeletal muscles

6
00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:14.599
which we can control.

7
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.066
The autonomic nervous system controls

8
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.899
involuntary responses

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.500
and has two components.

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.699
 The sympathetic system supports functions

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.933
that activate organs, such as involuntary

12
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.699
response to stress,

13
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.233
and the parasympathetic system increases 

14
00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:30.933
energy conserving responses. 

15
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.366
Examples of organs that respond to the

16
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.332
autonomic system include glands, smooth 

17
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.399
muscle in the stomach, and the heart.
