00:00:02.633 --> 00:00:04.533
Structurally, the nervous system is classified

2
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.933
into the central nervous system and the

3
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.966
peripheral nervous system.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.566
The central nervous system consists of the

5
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.266
brain and spinal cord. 

6
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.632
The brain receives sensory information and

7
00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:18.366
controls responses such as movement

8
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.632
behavior, memory, and thoughts.

9
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.866
The spinal cord communicates with the

10
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.032
peripheral nervous system, conducting 

11
00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:27.466
information to and from the brain.

12
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.766
Two types of neurons are found in the

13
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:31.899
peripheral nervous system.

14
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.333
The sensory neurons, connect to the eyes,

15
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.266
ears. and skin. and other sites where stimuli 

16
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.399
are received.

17
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.533
The motor neurons connect the central nervous

18
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.399
system to glands and muscles.

19
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.766
Motor neurons constitute the autonomic and

20
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.332
somatic nervous systems.

21
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.599
The autonomic nervous system controls

22
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.966
involuntary responses, and the sympathetic

23
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.066
component increases activity and the

24
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.966
parasympathetic system reduces activity. 

25
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.966
Both regulate organs such as glands, smooth

26
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.199
muscle in the stomach, and heart muscle.

27
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.599
The somatic nervous system controls voluntary

28
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.000
responses, such as the movement of

29
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.933
muscles.
