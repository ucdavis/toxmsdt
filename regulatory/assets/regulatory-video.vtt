00:00.417 --> 00:03.253
We've lived here for ten years
and we've never seen anything like it.

00:03.253 --> 00:05.130
The railroad tracks run
right behind our house,

00:05.130 --> 00:08.133
and we saw the smoke
and fire from our windows.

00:08.133 --> 00:10.051
Do we need to be worried
about the well? Water?

00:10.051 --> 00:14.556
Our windows are closed, but when we're
safe to open them again, we need answers.
