Also, the period of time between exposure and onset of symptoms. <br /><br />Substance<br />Physical material of which something is made. It may be element, compound, or a mixture of materials.<br /><br />Substrate<br />A substance acted upon. It often refers to the chemical that undergoes reaction with an enzyme.<br /><br />Synapse<br />The junction between the axon of one neuron and the dendrite of another neuron or an axon and a connection with a muscle cell <em>(neuromuscular junction)</em>.<br /><br />Systemic toxin<br />A toxin that affects the entire body or many organs.<br /><br /><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>

There are four types of tissues: epithelial tissue, connective tissue, muscle tissue, and nerve tissue.<br /><br />TLV<br /><em>see </em>Threshold Limit Value<br /><br />Tolerance<br />The ability to endure unusually large doses of a substance without ill effect.  Toxic effects are decreased with continued exposure to the substance.<br /><br />Total Dose<br />The sum of all individual doses which may be received over a period of time.<br /><br />Toxicant<br />An agent that produces adverse effects when absorbed into the body.<br /><br />Toxicokinetics<br />The pharmacokinetics of a toxic chemical.<br /><br />Toxicologist<br />A person who studies harmful effects of chemicals including the mechanisms by which the effects are produced and the probability that the effects will occur under specific exposure conditions.<br /><br />Toxicology<br />The study of the harmful interactions of chemicals on living organisms and biological systems.<br /><br />Toxin<br />A specific protein produced by certain plants, animals and microorganisms that is highly toxic to other organisms <em>(</em>e.g., <em>snake venom)</em>.<br /><br />Tumor<br /><em>see</em> Neoplasm<br /><br />Tumor Suppressor Gene<br />Genes present in normal cells that serve to prevent a cell with damaged DNA from proliferating and evolving into an uncontrolled growth. Sometimes referred to as anti-oncogenes. The p53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene.<br /><br /><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p>
