00:00.750 --> 00:05.505
The endocrine system provides hormones
that trigger responses in organs.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.383
This occurs in four steps.

00:08.383 --> 00:12.178
First, the endocrine gland synthesizes
the hormone.

00:12.554 --> 00:15.306
Second, the gland releases the hormone

00:15.306 --> 00:18.309
into blood to circulate around the body.

00:18.518 --> 00:22.522
Third, when the hormone in the blood
reaches the target organ,

00:22.772 --> 00:25.859
the hormone binds to a receptor
in the tissue.

00:26.317 --> 00:30.280
Fourth, in this example,
the activated receptor carries

00:30.280 --> 00:35.285
the hormone molecule to the nucleus,
where it triggers cell proliferation.
