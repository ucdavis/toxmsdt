00:02.293 --> 00:03.336
Cancer progresses in

00:03.336 --> 00:06.339
severity through a series of stages.

00:06.756 --> 00:10.010
Stage zero
is when the cancer is only in the cells

00:10.010 --> 00:13.596
where the cancer has started,
with no spread to surrounding tissue.

00:14.931 --> 00:17.559
When the cancer grows in size
but remains in the same

00:17.559 --> 00:20.562
tissue layer,
it is classified as stage one.

00:20.979 --> 00:23.982
At this point, it can be called a tumor.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.861
In stage two, the tumor has grown in size

00:28.028 --> 00:31.031
and penetrates
into other layers of surrounding tissue.

00:31.364 --> 00:34.325
The cancer may have moved into local lymph
nodes.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.288
By stage three,
the tumor is larger than in stage two,

00:38.580 --> 00:42.167
has penetrated deeper into tissues,
and even to beyond the normal

00:42.167 --> 00:43.460
boundary of the organ.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.463
The tumor can reach
regional and distal lymph nodes.

00:47.589 --> 00:50.925
Finally, stage four
the tumor becomes metastatic,

00:50.925 --> 00:54.637
meaning cancer cells
have entered the blood or lymph, circulate

00:54.637 --> 00:58.475
throughout the body and colonize sites
distant from the original site.

00:58.975 --> 01:01.478
The higher
the stage, the more severe the cancer.
