Double strand breaks are a specific type of DNA damage.

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.366
A piece of DNA is broken on both strands of the double helix.

3
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:15.366
A double strand break is detected by various proteins 

4
00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:19.433
leading to p53 causing the cell cycle to pause.

5
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:28.166
If the damage is extensive, genomic instability has occurred. and the cell will die by apoptosis.

6
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.400
Conversely, if the damage is not extensive, the DNA can be repaired through various 

7
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.766
mechanisms such as non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination.

8
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:48.299
Homologous recombination utilizes BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the repair process. 

9
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:54.599
With a successful repair, the DNA is no longer broken, and the cell cycle resumes. 

10
00:00:54.966 --> 00:01:00.066
If the repair is not successful, p53 can induce apoptosis of the cell.

11
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:06.699
In some cases, failed repairs can go unnoticed, the mutation is integrated into the genome,

12
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.200
and this can lead to cancer development.
