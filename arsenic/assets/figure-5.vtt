00:02.711 --> 00:04.838
Exposure to tumor promoter and tumor

00:04.838 --> 00:07.841
initiator can determine
whether cancer will develop.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.594
In experiment A,

00:11.594 --> 00:15.432
mice were treated on the skin
with one application of a tumor initiator.

00:15.598 --> 00:17.892
Represented with an orange arrow.

00:17.892 --> 00:20.895
Over time, no cancer developed.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.900
In experiment
B, mice were exposed to successive

00:25.900 --> 00:30.238
applications of a tumor promoter,
indicated here by a pink triangle.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.700
These mice also did not develop cancer.

00:36.244 --> 00:37.078
In experiment

00:37.078 --> 00:40.999
C, mice were treated with one application
of the tumor initiator,

00:40.999 --> 00:44.169
followed by successive applications
of the tumor promoter.

00:44.794 --> 00:48.506
This combination of the tumor initiator
followed by the tumor promoter

00:48.673 --> 00:51.676
did lead to cancer development.

00:52.927 --> 00:55.722
These experiments demonstrate
that cancers develop

00:55.722 --> 00:59.559
when exposure to an initiator
is followed by exposure to a promoter.
