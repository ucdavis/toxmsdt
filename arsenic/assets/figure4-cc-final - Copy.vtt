00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:02.733
The theory of carcinogenesis describes

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.499
how chemicals called initiators

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.733
cause DNA damage.

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.333
If the impact of the initiator

5
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.866
on DNA cannot be repaired,

6
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.666
these mutations can lead to

7
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.899
uncontrolled growth of the initiated cell.

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.433
Another factor, a promoter,

9
00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.899
can stimulate cell proliferation, 

10
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.500
leading to preneoplastic cells.

11
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.366
These cells can further mutate to neoplastic,

12
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:27.199
or cancerous cells, becoming a malignant

13
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.533
tumor, which can increase rapidly

14
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.733
in size.

15
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:32,766
If cells migrate out from the original location

16
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.866
and establish in another place, 

17
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.599
the cancer has metastasized.

18
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.632
Chemo-preventive blocking agents can stop

19
00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:41.366
the DNA repair that allows mutated cells

20
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.199
to grow.

21
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.666
and suppressing agents can slow or stop

22
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:45.666
progression of the growth.

23
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.566
Some agents inhibit invasion

24
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.366
and blood vessel formation (angiogenesis)

25
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.932
and can slow metastasis.
